AgriAid â€“ Empowering Farmers for Sustainable Agriculture

Goals 

*SDG 2: Zero Hunger: Under this framework, the aim of AgriAid is to assist farmers with improving productivity and enhancing food security through giving them the means of requisite survival. 
*SDG 12: Responsible Consumption: My intention is to promote environmentally-friendly farming practices, urging farmers to cut down on waste and to use resources judiciousl.
*SDG 13: Climate Action: In this regard, AgriAid informs the farmers timely about the weather conditions and gives them advice for pest control mitigation, which help them adapt to changing climatic challenges.

Roles

*Web/Mobile Application Developer:  From scratch, I will design an uncomplicated yet effective app that directly impacts small-scale farmers by providing timely weather updates, 
pest alerts, and market prices-the overall goal being sustainable farming.

Target Audience

*Small-Scale Farmers:  Those who practice farming in rural areas with limited access to modern tools and information. They will be the main end users of the app. 
*Farmers' Cooperatives and NGOs: The app can be utilized by groups and organizations that promote sustainable farming practices and support the community. 
*Governments and Local Authorities: The information obtained from the app can benefit governments in strengthening food security policies and action plans.

Problem and Solution
*The Issue: Small farmers smile at an unpredictable weather pattern, occasional outbreaks of pests, and rather troublesome marketing of their produce. 
*The AgriAid Solution:  This app enables farmers to receive weather forecasts in real-time, alerts on pest outbreaks, and the latest market prices. 
The information also encompasses organic farming so that farmers can improve production with less loss.

Objective

AgriAid aims to increase productivity among small-scale farmers and help them adopt eco-friendly farming methods. 
This supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in that it helps farmers grow food and better their livelihoods.
