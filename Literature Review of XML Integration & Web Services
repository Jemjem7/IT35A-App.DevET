XML Integration & Web Services: A Comparative Analysis

Overviews
THis report performs a comparative analysis of XML and JSON, common standards used in web services integration, 
with particular attention to the strenghts and weaknesses of each. 
Based on a review of literature, industrial practice, and real-world examples, the paper discusses optimal use cases for each data format, 
best practices, and considerations concerning performance.


Key Differences Between XML and JSON

XML: Strengths & Applications
* Structure: XML is a strongly structured. Hence, it is suitable for more complex and hierarchical data
  representation. XML is much favored in enterprise systems where data integrity and validation are very important. 
* Validation & Security: XML allows validating data using XML Schema and DTD, which is guarantees data correctness. 
  XML also has very strong securiy features like XML Encryprtion and XML signature, making it suitable for heavy regulation, 
  such as healthcare and finance.
* Real-World Use: Quite a significant chunk of XML is devoted to secure and reliable communication in SOAP-based web services, 
  particularly in enterprise applications like Salesforce.

JSON: Strengths & Applications
* Lightweight & Performance: Compact and easy for parsers, JSON has become the choice for REST APIs. 
  Simplicity is a win for the performance of mobile apps and web applications.
* Real-World Use: JSON is largely used in modern web platforms such as Facebook, where real-time data transfer should be as quick as possible.



Best Practices for Using XML and JSON

XML Best Practices
* XML is usefull for systems that require detailed data structures and strict validation rules.
* Industry compliance, including the fields such as finance or healthcare where the data transmitted and validate must occur securely.


JSON Best Practices
